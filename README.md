# Navigating
Basic HTML, CSS using for Navigation bar
It's main purpose is to create a navigation bar.
To beautify it, I crteated a Style.css file and using "list rel=" code and attached to it.
Then opened a div class called main and inside it opened a class called navigation bar and put the logo in it. and then use ul, li to create the files I need.
